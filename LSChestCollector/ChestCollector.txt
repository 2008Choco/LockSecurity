DISCLAIMER:
This is an add-on for LockSecurity, and will ONLY function when LockSecurity is installed on the server

NAME: LS-ChestCollector (ChestCollector)

New Commands:
	* /collects <item_stack>,<item_stack>,<item_stack> ... etc.
	- When run, it will act much like the /unlock command. It will put you in a mode until you right click a block
	- Running this command will store the parameters of item stacks you've specified.
	- In this mode, right clicking on a LOCKED CHEST owned by the player, will store the item stacks and bind it to that chest
	- That specific chest now has a specific function, similar to a hopper.
	- When a player picks up an item that was specified in the command (and now binded to the chest), the item will be pulled out of the player's
	  inventory, then automatically stored in the chest those items are binded to
	
Common Mistakes - Fixes:
	- When an item is picked up, check if there is room left in the chest! If there isn't any room left, keep it in the player's inventory and
	  send them a message letting them know it is full
	- If there are multiple chests with the same item binded to them, grab the first chest. If it's full, move on to the second chest, if it's
	  full, move on to the third chest, etc.. If all chests are full, refer to common mistakes 1
	  
Configuration Options:
	- HoppersCanExtractChests: true/false
		|-> Whether hoppers are able to pull an item from that locked chest or not
	- Maximum items: 5 (default)
		|-> The maximum amount of different items that are allowed to be binded to one chest
	- AutoSort?: true/false
		|-> Whether the chest should sort the items that are added in the chest or not
	- Cost: 100 (default)
		|-> If Vault is installed on the server, set a cost to create a Collection Chest

Requirements to Create a Collection Chest:
	- Implement Vault optionally. If Vault is installed, create a configuration option to determine how much it costs to create one
	- The chest MUST be a locked chest from LockSecurity
	- The chest MUST be owned by the player that wants to create the collection chest

Notes:
	- This will be created off of the LockSecurity API that will be created some time in the next couple of versions. We will see how much 
	  time I have to create more of an external API. This plugin will REQUIRE to have LockSecurity on the server, otherwise the plugin will 
	  not enable.
